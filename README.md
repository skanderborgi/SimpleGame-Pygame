# Meteor Simple game using pygame
### What is pygame?
Pygame is a set of modules for Python for making video games.it has a number of modules including ones for graphics, sound, and input. Even though pygame is easy and great for beginners it's not really sufficient for creating more complicated games.
### Libraries
..* pygame (of course)
..* random
..* math
..* time


### Overview
So I created a simple game called metor, the code has two parts:  
the first part contains some function definition of the elements (the spaceship for example) it contains: the location on X and Y ( X: the horizental and Y:vertical), knowing that the top screen Y=0 then, in the while loop we have our events (the game itself). We can see that we have an infinite loop to keep our game running.
